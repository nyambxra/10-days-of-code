# 10 Days of Code!

I failed terribly at 100 days of code, so I gave myself a ten-day challenge to work on three beginner-friendly projects and also get quick gratification. So, Chat-GPT suggested three projects that would showcase my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Interactive Quiz App
### Overview
I will design a quiz on a topic that I love. I will then create multiple choice questions, and give immediate feedback to the user when they select an answer
### Advanced Features
I can add a timer for each question, store high scores using Local Storage, and perhaps implement different difficulty levels.
### Technologies
HTML for structure, CSS for design, and JavaScript for interactivity and logic.

## Personal Dashboard/ To-Do List
### Overview
I will create a dashboard that users see every time they open a new tab. It can display the current time, a motivating quote (which changes every day or on reload), and a to-do list where tasks can be added, checked off, and deleted.
### Advanced Features
Add a background that changes based on the time of the day (morning, afternoon, evening, night). Intergrate  an external API to fetch the daily quote or even weather information based on teh user's location.
### Technologies
HTML, CSS for layout and styling, JavaScript for dynamic content updates, and LocalStorage or IndexedDB for storing to-do items.

## Memory Card Game (like Concentration)
first of all wym like concentration? Like "concentration is the game keep the rhythm if you can" ama?
### Overview
The game board consists of a grid of face-down cards. Each card has a matching card somewhere else in the grid. The goal is for the player to uncover all the matching pairs of cards with as few turns as possible.
### Advanced Features
Implement a scoring system (fewer moves = higher score), a timer to track how fast a player can match all cards, and different difficulty levels by increasing the number of cards.
### Technologies
HTML for the game board and cards, CSS for design and card flipping animations, JavaScript for the game logic and tracking the player's progress.
